# create_WLC_indices
The SuitabilityMappingTools.py script is a Python-based geospatial analysis tool designed to process, analyze, and conduct sensitivity assessments on raster datasets (GeoTIFF files).

The script is specifically built to facilitate weighted overlay analysis (WOA) or weighted linear combinations (WLC) for environmental and hydrological suitability mapping, using raster layers representing different thematic variables (e.g., subsurface infiltration potential).
